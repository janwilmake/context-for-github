- Add starcount
- Come up with examples and add buttons to easily prompt that to dashboard
  - Make available at secret, yet public, url

Make X post

```
I've been hacking together context.forgithub.com today, a little piece of context that shows an overview of all your repos within GitHub.

- Never a problem
```

Organisation repos not shown... why?

MCP (add it as a resource in an authenticated MCP, so it can easily be selected in many clients).

Maybe: LLM prompt over this

Think about how to further make it useful

# Backlog

**list app in marketplace** https://github.com/settings/applications/2895859

**Get emails** Maybe get all emails from previous logins into dashboard.forgithub.com via https://github.com/janwilmake/sponsorflare, because i could let them all know that the thing they subscribed for now exists. 1000 people, 10% conversion, $10/m, could be on $1000/m directly! however, lets see first if people from uithub are at all interested.
