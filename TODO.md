- ✅ Make available at secret, yet public, url
- ✅ Come up with examples and add buttons to easily prompt that to dashboard

- Use task api for each repo to gather a summary of it

Make X post

**Get emails** Maybe get all emails from previous logins into dashboard.forgithub.com via https://github.com/janwilmake/sponsorflare, because i could let them all know that the thing they subscribed for now exists. 1000 people, 10% conversion, $10/m, could be on $1000/m directly! however, lets see first if people from uithub are at all interested.
