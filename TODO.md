The perfect uithub add-on: https://github.com/janwilmake/context-for-github.git

Buy a high-level context overview for your repos for $10/month.

Never loose context again of what you are working on. It's literally the context to copy/paste you're paying for, not a dashboard!

Categories:

- Lists
- Forked
- You're owner
- Organisation is owner
- Stars

Every day it should update this list for you and make it available. There should be an MCP such that you can easily access it as a resource.

**Get emails** Maybe get all emails from previous logins into dashboard.forgithub.com via https://github.com/janwilmake/sponsorflare, because i could let them all know that the thing they subscribed for now exists. 1000 people, 10% conversion, $10/m, could be on $1000/m directly! however, lets see first if people from uithub are at all interested.
